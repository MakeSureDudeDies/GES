# UES - Unified Environment Standard
A new standard for Lua.

# Who are we?
We are a group of passionate people working together to create a new standard for Lua.

# What happened?
This project has been abandoned by the other people working on it. The actual project will now be on my (MakeSureDudeDies') repository https://github.com/MakeSureDudeDies/UES
